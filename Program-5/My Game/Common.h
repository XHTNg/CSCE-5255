/// CCommon is a singleton class that encapsulates 
/// things that are common to different game components,
/// including game state variables.
/// Making it a singleton class means
/// that we can avoid passing its member variables
/// around as parameters, which makes the code
/// minisculely faster, and more importantly, reduces
/// function clutter.
