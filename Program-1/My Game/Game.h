/// must contain the following public member functions. `Initialize()` does
/// initialization and will be run exactly once at the start of the game.
/// `ProcessFrame()` will be called once per frame to create and render the
/// next animation frame. `Release()` will be called at game exit but before
/// any destructors are run.
