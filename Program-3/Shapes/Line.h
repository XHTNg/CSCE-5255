/// \brief Line shape.
///
/// A line is infinite in both directions. It consists of
/// its gradient \f$m\f$ and \f$y\f$-incercept \f$c\f$, that is, it has the
/// equation \f$y = mx + c\f$. The gradient can be infinite, in
/// that case it has the equation \f$x = b\f$, where \f$b\f$ is its \f$x\f$-intercept.
/// Note that there is no line descriptor class CLineDesc. That is to
/// discourage the use of lines outside this project. If you
/// are thinking of using one, I recommend that you use a line segment instead.
