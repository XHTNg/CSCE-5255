/// \brief A gate.
///
/// A gate allows balls to cross in one direction only. It's essentially a line
/// segment with a couple of Boolean variables and some code that handles the
/// crossing-in-one-direction requirement. Care must be taken to do the right
/// thing when a ball gets nudged back while in the process of crossing.
///
/// A gate can be open or closed, latched or unlatched. When it is open, there
/// can be no collisions. When it is closed, balls collide with it if they are
/// travelling from one side but not the other. More specifically, if the vector
/// from the ball's center to the POI is in the opposite direction to  the line
/// segment's normal vector `CLineSeg::m_vNormal` then they can cross. Recall that
/// the direction of `CLineSeg::m_vNormal` depends on the order in which
/// `CLineSeg`'s end points were specified, so make sure you get it right.

/// \brief A flipper.
///
/// From Wikipedia:
/// "The flippers are one or more small mechanically or electromechanically
/// controlled levers, roughly 3 to 7 cm in length, used for redirecting the
/// ball up the playfield. They are the main control that the player has over
/// the ball. Careful timing and positional control allows the player to
/// intentionally direct the ball in a range of directions with various levels
/// of velocity. With the flippers, the player attempts to move the ball to hit
/// various types of scoring targets, and to keep the ball from disappearing off
/// the bottom of the playfield." `CFlipper` implements one of those. It's made
/// up of a couple of circles and a couple of line segments that are tangents to
/// both of them.
